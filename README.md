# Sorting Array Elements
## About The Project
*This is a Sorting program that Sorts the integer Values of an array that entered by the user 
and print them in either*
1. Assending Order Sort
2. Dessending Order Sort
3. In Both of them

*Using one of these three Sorting Algorithms:*
1. Insertion Sort
2. Selection Sort
3. Bubble Sort

## Tools
* Assembly Programming Language
* Visual Studio Code (Editor)
* Irvine Library
* MASM32 (Compiler)
* CMD (Excuting Code)

## Sorting Algorithms
### 1. Selection Sort 

*   *In This Sorting Technique of the Array Elements assuming ascending order technique we are iterating over the array elements that are unsorted to find the maximum one and swapping it at the end with last   un sorted one and repeat this again until the whole array is sorted.*


* **_For Example :_**

*  **_Time Complexity:_**
    
     O(n^2^)
